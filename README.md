# ObjAs - Objective Assembly

Object-oriented assembler and assembly language prototype for RV32I architecture. 
The project is in early stages of development.

## Features (planned)

- Object-oriented programming at the assembly level
- Classes with inheritance and encapsulation
- Namespacing
- Virtual methods and polymorphism

## Concept

ObjAs follows the philosophy that assembler does not add hidden CPU instructions 
without explicit instruction from programmer.
